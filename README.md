Hi 👋 My name is Yuri
==========================

Inevitably, due to several years (Master & double-Ph.D.) in contact with exact sciences, I have developed the ability to learn fast, solve complex problems, have critical thinking skills and specially work under pressure. Furthermore, I have obtained good social skills, e.g. communication, presentation and publication of the results in scientific journals. I was dragged into programming for the first time in late 2022 to learn python to develop software for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipments; but I fall in love with javascript.

* 🌍 I'm based in Rio de Grande do Sul, Brazil
* ⚡ My web page is: www.yurisokolovicz.com
* 🧠 I'm learning Advanced Javascript, CSS and Web Design.
* ✉️ You can contact me at yurisokolovicz@gmail.com
* ⭐ Professional English Proficiency - My Ph.D. degree is from a France institution in which English is one of the official languages - proficiency proof
* ✈️ Totally adapted to living in another country: 1 year working in France and 2 in Italy (Postdoctoral Fellowship). 

Don't be afraid of the man who knows a thousand languages, be afraid of the man who has trained the same language a thousand times. JS is true power.
